A tetris clone for MES (https://github.com/menga-team/MES).

This project should act as a more advanced example for creating your
own MES games.  It implements a modern tetris game with the SRS,
ability to hold tetrominos and a preview of the next tetrominos.

You can play it either in single player or challange a friend to
multiplayer.  The multiplayer mode uses similar mechanics to the
Gameboy version.

For more extensive instructions on playing the game, please see the
provided INSTRUCTIONS file.
